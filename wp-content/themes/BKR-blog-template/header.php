		<p>Post Hi, I’m a Linux enthusiast with some programming experience. This is my personal blog which I use to post whatever I feel like. So feel free to take a look arouThis option is active when a rectangle selection is drawn. Clicking on the Auto Shrink Selection button will make the selection automatically shrink to the nearest rectangular shape including elements in the selection. The algorithm for finding the best rectangle to shrink to is “intelligent”, which in this case means that it sometimes does surprisingly sophisticated things, and sometimes does surprisingly strange things. In any case, if the region that you want to select has a solid-colored surround, auto-shrinking will always pick it out correctly. Note that the resulting selection does not need to have the same shape as the one you sweep out. nd!</p>
